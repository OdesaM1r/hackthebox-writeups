This document will detail how I beat the Appointment machine in Hack The Box's starting point path.

To recap from the last two machines, they featured relatively simple and straightforward techniques to get the flags. However, now that I'm on the next tier of machines, the techniques I have to utilize will become progressivelly complex.

To get an initial reading of the situation, I ran nmap to scan the ports of the target IP.

Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-06-11 02:43 UTC
Nmap scan report for 10.129.165.166
Host is up (0.29s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open  http

Unlike the other machines I've done prior, I only had access to the HTTP port. HTTP is not a vulnerability I'm familiar with, so I had to do some research.

In order to crack this machine, I'm going to have to do IP Enumaration, which is basically the process of gaining further information on a given IP.

My first step was to find the version of the HTTP connection, which required me to run nmap -sC -sV (Target IP)

Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-06-11 02:46 UTC

I pasted the IP into my browser, getting to a login page. From there I tried an SQL injection to see if I could get into a hidden page.

Now, up until this point I've only had trivial experience with XSS and SQL, so I needed to do some research on what I needed to do next.

I decided to go to W3 Schools to read up on the topic:
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp

I tried putting " or ""=" into both the username and password fields.

It didn't work.

At this point, I admit, I got stuck. So i referred to the guide. It turns out that my assumption of an SQL injection was correct, but I went about it wrong.

In order to progress, I used the directed "admin'#" and any password. From there, I managed to get the flag.


Congratulations!

Your flag is: e3d0796d002a446c0e622226f42e9672

And that's how, with a mix of my own research and help from the guide, I cracked the appointment machine.
