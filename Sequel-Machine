This writeup will detail how I cracked the Sequel box on the Hack The Box Sequel machine in the Starting Point path.

Started off with an nmap scan to see what was open:

nmap -sC -sV 10.129.166.34
Only port 3306 (MySQL) was open. The service was MariaDB version 10.3.27. Looked like it didn’t require a password to access, so I tried connecting straight in:


mysql -u root -h 10.129.166.34
Got in right away with root access, no password. From there, I ran show databases; and found a custom one called htb alongside the usual system ones.

Switched into the htb database and listed the tables:

USE htb;
show tables;
There were two: config and users. I went into config first just to see what kind of data it had:


SELECT * FROM config;
It dumped out a bunch of settings, but what stood out was this line:


flag | 7b4bec00d1a39e3dd4e021ec3d915da8
Flag was just sitting there in plain text.

Super simple box. No exploitation needed. MySQL was completely exposed, and the root account didn’t require a password. The flag was stored in a readable table under the htb database. Just needed basic enumeration to grab it.
